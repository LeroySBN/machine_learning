Recommendation systems use ratings that users have given items to make specific recommendations to users.

Companies like Amazon sell many products to many customers and permit these customers to rate their products can collect massive data sets that can be used to predict what rating a given user will give a specific item. Items for which a high rating is predicted for specific users are then recommended to that user. Netflix uses recommendation systems to predict how many stars a user will give a specific movie.

Here we provide the basics of how these recommendations are predicted, motivated by some of the approaches taken by the winners of the [Netflix challenge](https://netflixtechblog.com/netflix-recommendations-beyond-the-5-stars-part-1-55838468f429).

We do not have the Netflix data here but the GroupLens research lab generated their own database. We shall create a recommendation system using this data.

In this project, we create a movie recommendation system using the MovieLens dataset. Our main aim is to perform a data analysis and through visualization, find patterns to assist us in building a model that will provide an optimum movie recommendation to users.
